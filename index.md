# Welcome!

This site contains lecture notes, tutorials, and assignment instructions for COMP 4630: Machine Learning. Use the sidebar on the left to view the material, and if you notice a problem, please report an issue at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mru-comp4630/w26).

Sometimes I'll write stuff on the board. You can find a version of my scribbles [here](lectures/4630%20w26%20notes.pdf), which I'll try to keep more or less up to date.
